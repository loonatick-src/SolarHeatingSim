# Rudimentary Solar Water Heating System Simulation
We make the following assumptions and simplifications
- Flat plate collector with parallel riser tubes
- Temperature variations along the width of the solar collector (i.e. perpendicular to fluid flow direction) are not modelled, assume uniform mean temperature along with.
- Single phase regime -- the fluid does not undergo phase change
- Changes in specific heat capacity with temperature are negligible for all materials in the operating range
- Fixed ambient temperature, wind speed (i.e. fixed convection heat transfer coefficients), sky temperature, and solar irradiation
- Working fluid is incompressible, mass flow rate is constant throughout the system
- Heat exchanges occur only at the collector and storage tank, no heat transfer at pipes or pump
- The work done by the pump is completely balanced by e.g. the changes in potential energy in the storage tank and riser tubes, so it does not appear in the balance equations
- Radial temperature of the fluid is not modelled - assume an overall mean temperature across the cross section

## Subsystems
### Collector
We consider a flat plate collector with parallel riser tubes (TODO: add figure) modelled as an absorber plate transfering heat to the fluid in the risers. This model is based on the work of [4]. Heat transfer between plate and fluid modelled as convection using Newton's law of cooling [1].
#### Plate
We have the following processes
- Solar radiation, $\propto T_p^4 - T_{\text{sky}}^4$ (Stefan-Boltzmann law)
- Convective transfer to fluid, $\propto  T_p - T_f$ (Newton's law of cooling)
- Convective loss to atmosphere, $\propto T_p - T_a$ (Newton's law of cooling)

$$\rho_p \delta \frac{\partial T_p}{\partial t} = S - h_{pf}(T_p - T_f) - h_{pa}(T_p - T_a) - \alpha(T_p^4 - T_{\text{sky}}^4)$$

where $\alpha$ is a constant that includes the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, emissivities etc. This equation equation models heat transfer rate per unit area of the collector. Since we assume no dynamics along the width of the collector, we multiply the equation by the width $W$ of the collector to get the dynamics along the length of the conductor ($T_p = T_p(t, y)$).

$$W\rho_p \delta \frac{\partial T_p}{\partial t} = WS - Wh_{pf}(T_p - T_f) - Wh_{pa}(T_p - T_a) - W\alpha(T_p^4 - T_{\text{sky}}^4)$$

#### Working Fluid
We model heat transfer through and by the fluid using a 1D advection equation with the source term being the plate-fluid convective transfer term.

$$\rho_fC_{pf}$$


## Storage Tank
We use a stratified, well-mixed tank model (TODO: add figure)
$$\rho V C_p \frac{dT_{l,i}}{dt} = \dot{m} C_p T_{l,i-1} - T_{l,i} - h_{ta}A(T_{l,i} - T_a),$$
for $i \in 1 \ldots N_s$, where $N_s$ is the number of stratification layers, (model parameter). We let $T_{l,0}(t) = T_f(t, L)$. The assumption here is that the pipes are short or transport from collector to tank is sufficiently fast.
Note that $T_l$ is the temperature of the same working fluid as in the collector, but we use a different subscript to distinguish between the two systems.
This model is based on lecture 29 of [3].

## Numerical Considerations
We use central differences for spatial derivatives in the collector equations.

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \approx \frac{T_{i+1} - T_{i-1}}{\Delta y},$$

where $T_i = T(t, i\Delta y)$.
